# Book Recommender System

## I. Task description

The  goal of this project is to build a recommendation engine that aims to help users find books which might be interesting for them based on their summaries. We'll do this by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA algorithm.

>> Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a type of unobserved learning algorithm in which topics are inferred from a dictionary of text corpora whose structures are not known (are latent). The practical use of such an algorithm is to solve the cold-start problem, whereby analytics can be done on texts to derive similarities in the dictionary's corpses, and further be expanded to others outside the original scope - all without user input, which is often an early stumbling block for businesses that do not meet early usage quotas to derive needed analysis.

The data for the project [...]

Next is an overview of the work related to this topic, and then the theoretical explanation behind LDA to lay the foundation for our implementation. Finally, we will study the complete code and introduce the specific results of the algorithm, and discuss some of its shortcomings.
